The code runs on Windows 7 with MATLAB 2009b.

The main tracking function is in tracker.m and the parameters related to image sequences are set in setTrackParam.m

The initial tracking uses two functions vl_kdtreebuild and vl_kdtreequery from the VLFeat open source library.

The formal tracking uses the following SPArse Modeling Software.

The results are slightly sensitive to affine parameters. You may obtain better results by adjusting the parameters.
